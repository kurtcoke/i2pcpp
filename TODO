Double check locking requirements. Ensure that locking is initiated by the object which owns the data to be locked (etc).
JSON-RPC(?) and HTML5 control panel.
Convert everything in tunnel/ to its own namespace.
Investigate text based configuration.
Identify and use c++11 algorithms where possible.
Handle edge cases in --importdir.
Add exceptions with backtrace support.
Write unit tests (ongoing).
Ensure that unused objects get destroyed (expire tunnels after 10 minutes, etc).
Make UDPTransport its own library.
Investigate whether the Version.cpp/.h system should be modified.
Reimplement OMS internals in a more sane way (no bitset).
Use a list<Fragment> instead of a vector<FragmentPtr> for PacketBuilder.

DHT
* in-progress table
* max concurrent lookups
* only return N peers in the initial Kademlia lookup (not the whole bucket)
* negative lookup cache
* better timeout logic

Add error codes to C API (handle all exceptions).
Package everything nicely.
