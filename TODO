Refactoring and small changes:
* Comment/document the code and usage (ongoing).
* Convert shared_ptr --> unique_ptr where necessary.
* Double check locking requirements. Ensure that locking is initiated by the object which owns the data to be locked (etc).
* Identify and use c++11 algorithms where possible.
* Handle edge cases in --importdir.
* Write unit tests (ongoing).
* Add exceptions with backtrace support.
* Ensure that unused objects get destroyed (expire tunnels after 10 minutes, etc).
* Add error codes to C API (handle all exceptions).

New features:
* Implement exploratory tunnel support.
* JSON-RPC(?) and HTML5 control panel.
* NTCP
* DHT
    - in-progress table
    - max concurrent lookups
    - better timeout logic

Structural changes:
* As part of libssu's initialization, config parameters will need to be passed. These parameters should be stored in a text file (boost propertytree). This obsoletes the `config' table in the libi2p database.

Ideas to investigate:
* Text based configuration.
* Modification of the Version.cpp/.h system.
